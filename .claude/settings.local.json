They begin with basic ROS 2 nodes and services, advance through digital twin simulation, work with NVIDIA Isaac tools, and conclude with voice and cognitive planning using VLA models.\n\n**Why this priority**: This represents the core value proposition of the book - providing a complete learning pathway from beginner to advanced AI robotics concepts.\n\n**Independent Test**: Students can successfully complete Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals) and have a working understanding of nodes, topics, and services with rclpy, demonstrating foundational knowledge of robot communication systems.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a student with basic programming knowledge, **When** they complete Module 1, **Then** they can create and connect ROS 2 nodes with custom messages and services\n2. **Given** a student who has completed Module 1, **When** they work with URDF definitions, **Then** they can create and visualize robot models with proper joint configurations\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Digital Twin Simulation Experience (Priority: P2)\n\nAn aspiring robotics developer wants to practice robotics concepts in a simulated environment before working with physical robots. They need to understand physics simulation, sensor modeling, and how to test robot behaviors in a safe, repeatable environment.\n\n**Why this priority**: Simulation is essential for robotics development and allows for rapid iteration and testing without hardware costs or safety concerns.\n\n**Independent Test**: Students can set up a Gazebo or Unity environment with realistic physics and sensor simulation (LiDAR, IMU) that behaves similarly to real-world sensors.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a simulated environment, **When** students implement sensor fusion algorithms, **Then** the system accurately combines LiDAR and IMU data for navigation\n2. **Given** a robot model in simulation, **When** students run physics-based navigation tests, **Then** the robot behavior matches expected real-world physics\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - NVIDIA Isaac Integration Mastery (Priority: P3)\n\nAn advanced robotics practitioner wants to leverage NVIDIA''s Isaac ecosystem for computer vision, SLAM, and navigation. They need to understand how to integrate Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS packages, VSLAM algorithms, and Nav2 path planning.\n\n**Why this priority**: This represents the industrial-grade tools that professionals use for complex robotics applications.\n\n**Independent Test**: Students can successfully implement VSLAM in Isaac Sim and achieve reliable localization and mapping in complex environments.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a complex 3D environment in Isaac Sim, **When** students run VSLAM algorithms, **Then** the system generates accurate 3D maps and maintains precise localization\n2. **Given** a robot with navigation goals, **When** students configure Nav2 path planning, **Then** the robot successfully navigates around obstacles to reach destinations\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Voice and Cognitive AI Integration (Priority: P4)\n\nA robotics AI researcher wants to integrate advanced AI capabilities including voice recognition and cognitive planning. They need to understand how to incorporate Whisper for voice processing, LLMs for high-level planning, and coordinate these with traditional robotics systems.\n\n**Why this priority**: This represents cutting-edge integration of AI and robotics for next-generation intelligent systems.\n\n**Independent Test**: Students can create a system that accepts voice commands via Whisper and translates them into robot actions using cognitive planning.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** voice input in natural language, **When** processed through Whisper integration, **Then** the system accurately transcribes and interprets the command\n2. **Given** high-level goals, **When** processed through LLM-based cognitive planning, **Then** the system generates executable sequences of robotic actions\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when sensor simulation fails or produces unrealistic data?\n- How does the system handle conflicts between voice commands and autonomous navigation?\n- What occurs when VSLAM fails in visually degraded environments (low light, repetitive textures)?\n- How does the system recover when Nav2 path planning cannot find a valid route?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST provide hands-on exercises for each module allowing students to implement concepts in code\n- **FR-002**: System MUST include sample projects and code repositories for each module (ROS 2, Digital Twin, Isaac, VLA)\n- **FR-003**: System MUST offer simulation environments compatible with both Gazebo and Unity platforms\n- **FR-004**: System MUST demonstrate proper integration of ROS 2 with NVIDIA Isaac tools and libraries\n- **FR-005**: System MUST provide working examples of Whisper voice processing integrated with robotic control systems\n- **FR-006**: System MUST showcase LLM-based cognitive planning for robotic task decomposition\n- **FR-007**: System MUST include a comprehensive capstone project integrating all four modules\n- **FR-008**: System MUST provide debugging and troubleshooting guides for common issues in each module\n- **FR-009**: System MUST demonstrate sensor simulation accuracy for LiDAR and IMU in virtual environments\n- **FR-010**: System MUST implement Nav2 path planning with dynamic obstacle avoidance\n\n### Key Entities\n\n- **Learning Modules**: Educational units containing theory, practical exercises, and assessments for each topic area\n- **Simulation Environments**: Virtual worlds with physics engines and sensor models for testing robotic algorithms\n- **Robot Models**: URDF and SDF representations of robots with proper kinematics, dynamics, and sensor configurations\n- **AI Integration Points**: Interfaces between traditional robotics systems and AI models for perception, planning, and control\n- **Capstone Project**: Final comprehensive project that demonstrates mastery of all four modules\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Students can complete all four modules within 12-16 weeks of study with 80% assignment completion rate\n- **SC-002**: Students demonstrate proficiency by successfully completing the capstone project with all four module components integrated\n- **SC-003**: 90% of students can independently set up and run simulation environments after completing Module 2\n- **SC-004**: Students achieve 95% success rate in basic navigation tasks using Nav2 after completing Module 3\n- **SC-005**: Students can implement voice-controlled robot commands using Whisper integration with 90% accuracy\n- **SC-006**: Students can create LLM-driven task planning systems that decompose complex goals into executable robot actions\n- **SC-007**: The curriculum enables learners to transition to professional robotics roles within 6 months of completion\")",
