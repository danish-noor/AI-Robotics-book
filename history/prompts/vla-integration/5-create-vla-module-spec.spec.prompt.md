## Prompt

Create detailed specification, plan, and tasks for the fourth module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course focusing on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive documentation for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models module including: 1) A detailed specification (spec.md) outlining learning objectives aligned with constitution principles, prerequisites, module structure, hands-on projects, and technical requirements for multimodal AI in robotics; 2) An implementation plan (plan.md) detailing the approach, architecture, quality assurance, and alignment with constitution principles; 3) A task breakdown (tasks.md) with specific, actionable items organized in phases across 8 weeks of development.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete spec/plan/tasks for VLA models integration module (capstone)
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created specs/vla-integration/spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation of the VLA integration module
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully applied Spec-Driven Development methodology to create comprehensive educational content focused on multimodal AI for embodied robotics

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing the first tasks in the tasks.md file
