## Prompt

Break down the implementation into:

* Scaffolding the Docusaurus project.
* Creating Markdown files for each module with code snippets.
* Setting up the GitHub Actions workflow for deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive task breakdown for AI Robotics Book Curriculum. Created 69 specific, actionable tasks organized across 9 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (Docusaurus project initialization)
- Phase 2: Foundational (Core documentation infrastructure)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - ROS 2 fundamentals with code snippets
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Simulation & Digital Twins with examples
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - NVIDIA Isaac integration with code
- Phase 6: User Story 4 - VLA & Human-Robot Interaction with examples
- Phase 7: Capstone project integration
- Phase 8: GitHub Actions deployment workflow
- Phase 9: Polish & cross-cutting concerns

Tasks follow proper format with IDs, parallelization markers, and user story labels. Each user story is organized to be independently implementable and testable.
